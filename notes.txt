every note play event overrides any previously playing note
there is  a 'stop playing note' button
but a note keeps ringing out until you stop them

the instrument is strictly monotonic - only one note will play at a time

the D-pad are the frets - 0-4 (5 notes)
the face buttons (A,B,X,Y) are the strings - when pressed, they sound out the note selected by the D-pad
each face button's notes start after the range of the last one:

North Face Button: Triangle on Playstation, Y on Xbox
East Face button: Circle on Playstation, B on Xbox, A on Nintendo
South Face button: X on Playstation, A on Xbox, B on Nintendo
West Face Button: Square on Playstation, X on Xbox, Y on Nintendo

centre buttons (select/start etc):
left one: toggle +/- 1 octave
right one: toggle +/- 2 octaves

there should be a button which toggles sustain mode - switches the controller between acting as described above (where notes keep ringing until replaced or cancelled),
and a 'stop playing any notes' button - to stop the drone, and as a last-resort panic button to cease all midi notes

if holding an analogue stick fully out from the centre before pressing a note AND there is already a note currently playing,
then you can slide between the currently playing note and the note you are pressing now,
by moving the stick between where it started when you started pressing the note,
and the opposite side (between north and south, between east and west, between northeast and southwest - between the starting point and its 180 degree opposed position)

finally, see if you can squeeze in the volume expression on the other analogue stick
